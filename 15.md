NIP-15
======

End of Stored Events Notice
---------------------------

`final` `optional` `author:Semisol`

Relays may support notifying clients when all stored events have been sent.

If a relay supports this NIP, the relay SHOULD send the client a `EOSE` message in the format `["EOSE", <subscription_id>]` after it has sent all the events it has persisted and it indicates all the events that come after this message are newly published.

在发完本地存储的事件后发送，表示之后所有事件是新发布的。

Client Behavior
---------------

Clients SHOULD use the `supported_nips` field to learn if a relay supports end of stored events notices.

Motivation
----------

The motivation for this proposal is to reduce uncertainty减少不确定性 when all events have been sent by a relay to make client code possibly less complex.
