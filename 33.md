NIP-33
======

Parameterized Replaceable Events
--------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:Semisol` `author:Kukks` `author:Cameri` `author:Giszmo`

这个 NIP 添加了一个新的事件范围，允许替换具有相同d标签和kind的事件，这与 NIP-16 仅按kind替换不同。

实现
--------------
The value of a tag is defined as the first parameter of a tag after the tag name.

A *parameterized replaceable event* is defined as an event with a kind `30000 <= n < 40000`.  
Upon a parameterized replaceable event with a newer timestamp than the currently known latest
replaceable event with the same kind and first `d` tag value being received, the old event
SHOULD be discarded and replaced with the newer event.  
A missing or a `d` tag with no value should be interpreted equivalent to a `d` tag with the
value as an empty string. Events from the same author with any of the following `tags`
replace each other:

* `"tags":[["d",""]]`
* `"tags":[]`: implicit `d` tag with empty value
* `"tags":[["d"]]`: implicit empty value `""`
* `"tags":[["d",""],["d","not empty"]]`: only first `d` tag is considered
* `"tags":[["d"],["d","some value"]]`: only first `d` tag is considered
* `"tags":[["e"]]`: same as no tags
* `"tags":[["d","test","1"]]`: only the value is considered (`test`)

Clients SHOULD NOT use `d` tags with multiple values and SHOULD include the `d` tag even if it has no value to allow querying using the `#d` filter.
客户端不应该使用d具有多个值的标签，并且应该包括d标签，即使它没有允许使用#d过滤器查询的值。

Client Behavior
---------------

Clients SHOULD use the `supported_nips` field to learn if a relay supports this NIP.
Clients MAY send parameterized replaceable events to relays that may not support this NIP, and clients querying SHOULD be prepared for the relay to send multiple events and should use the latest one and are recommended to send a `#d` tag filter. Clients should account for the fact that missing `d` tags or ones with no value are not returned in tag filters, and are recommended to always include a `d` tag with a value.

客户端应该使用该`supported_nips`字段来了解Relay是否支持此 NIP。
客户端可能向不支持此 NIP 的Relay发送参数化可替换事件，并且客户端查询应该为Relay发送多个事件做好准备，并且应该使用最新的一个，并建议发送#d标签过滤器。
客户应该考虑到缺少d标签或没有值的标签不会在标签过滤器中返回，并且建议始终包含d带有值的标签。
