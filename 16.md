NIP-16
======

事件处理
---------------

`draft` `optional` `author:Semisol`

Relays may decide to allow replaceable and/or ephemeral events.

常规事件
------------------
kind = [1000, 10000) Relay正常处理，存储、转发正常事件，新事件不影响前一个事件
A *regular event* is defined as an event with a kind `1000 <= n < 10000`.
Upon a regular event being received, the relay SHOULD send it to all clients with a matching filter, and SHOULD store it. New events of the same kind do not affect previous events in any way.

可替换的事件
------------------
kind = [10000, 20000) 对于同样pubkey和kind的可替换事件，新时间戳的事件将会替换旧时间戳的事件
A *replaceable event* is defined as an event with a kind `10000 <= n < 20000`.
Upon a replaceable event with a newer timestamp than the currently known latest replaceable event with the same kind being received, and signed by the same key, the old event SHOULD be discarded and replaced with the newer event.

临时事件
----------------
kind = [20000, 30000) relay只转发而不存储事件
An *ephemeral event* is defined as an event with a kind `20000 <= n < 30000`.
Upon an ephemeral event being received, the relay SHOULD send it to all clients with a matching filter, and MUST NOT store it.

Client Behavior
---------------

Clients SHOULD use the `supported_nips` field to learn if a relay supports this NIP.  Clients SHOULD NOT send ephemeral events to relays that do not support this NIP; they will most likely be persisted.  Clients MAY send replaceable events to relays that may not support this NIP, and clients querying SHOULD be prepared for the relay to send multiple events and should use the latest one.  
客户端不能发送临时事件到不支持本nip的relay，他们将可能被持久化；
客户端可发送可替换事件到不支持本nip的relay，查询时relay将发送多个事件，Client要做好准备使用最新的那个

建议用例
-------------------

* States: An application may create a state event that is replaced every time a new state is set (such as statuses) 状态用可替换事件
* Typing indicators: A chat application may use ephemeral events as a typing indicator. 输入提示用临时事件
* Messaging: Two pubkeys can message over nostr using ephemeral events. 两个公钥可通过临时事件发送消息
